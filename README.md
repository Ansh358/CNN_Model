# 🧠 Image Classification using CNN (CIFAR-10)

This project is about building a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

The model can recognize 10 different objects like cats, airplanes, trucks, and more.

## 📁 Dataset

- **CIFAR-10**
- 60,000 images (32x32 size)
- 10 classes:
  - Airplane, Car, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn

---

## 🔍 What the Model Does

- Uses Conv2D layers to extract features from images
- MaxPooling to reduce size
- Dense layers for final classification
- Trained over multiple epochs and tested on unseen data

---

## 📈 Output

- Training and validation graphs
- Accuracy score on test data
- Classification report
- Sample image predictions
